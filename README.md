# Tournament-Results
Swiss pairing for tournament with even numbered player implemented using python and postgreSQL.

## Motivation
Cloned the code skeleton from github as provided by Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree program and developed the code on virtual environment. I used VirtualBox to run the VM and configured it using Vagrant

## Installation
Requires Python and PsotgreSQL to be installed

## Usage
Execute the tournament_test.py file

## Tests
tournament_test.py contains a list of  unit tests to test functions that registers players, deletes table contents, counts number of registered players, displays sorted winners scoreboard and generates pairs based on swiss pairing technique.

## Credits
Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree provided the code skeleton to implement this project
